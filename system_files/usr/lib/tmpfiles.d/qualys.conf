# Writable agent directory
# The agent is copied from /usr/libexec/qualys/cloud-agent (immutable) to /var/opt/qualys/cloud-agent (writable)
# on first boot by the activation script, because the agent needs to write Config.db and other files
d /var/opt 0755 root root -
d /var/opt/qualys 0755 root root -

# Note: /var/opt/qualys/cloud-agent is created and populated by the first-boot activation script
# It copies the entire agent directory from the immutable location to allow writes
